This is a command line utility to download and install Xcode in headless mode (from a Terminal only).

It works either interactively or unattended. In **interactive mode**, it prompts you for your Apple Developer account username, password and MFA code.  In **unattended mode**, it fetches your Apple Developer username and password from AWS Secrets Manager. (Instructions to configure this are below)

When** MFA is configured** (which we highly recommend), a human interraction is required to enter the MFA code sent to your device.  This step cannot be automated.

The username and password ARE NOT STORED on the local volumes. They are used to interract with Apple's Developer Portal API and collect a session token.  The session token is stored in `$HOME/.xcodeinstall` in *interactive mode* or on AWS Secrets Manager when using it. The session stays valid for several days, sometimes weeks before it expires.  When the session expires, you have to authenticate again.

## Why install Xcode in headless mode?

When preparing a macOS machine in the cloud for CI/CD, you don't always have access to the login screen, or you don't want to access it.

It is a best practice to automate the preparation of your build environment to ensure they are always identical.
